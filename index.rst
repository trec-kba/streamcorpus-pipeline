Welcome to StreamCorpus
=======================

StreamCorpus provides a toolkit for processing massive streams of text
and running natural language extractors on the text.  StreamCorpus
does not provide any extractors itself; it operates third-party
extractors, such as Serif and Factorie, and unifies their output.
StreamCorpus pipline can store documents in S3, Accumulo, or flat
files.

StreamCorpus is used extensively in `TREC KBA <http://trec-kba.org/>`_
and at `Diffeo <http://diffeo.com/>`_.

Ask more at `StreamCorpus Google Group <http://groups.google.com/group/streamcorpus>`_

All of these python package are hosted in `github.com/trec-kba <http://github.com/trec-kba/>`_ 
and `github.com/diffeo <http://github.com/diffeo/>`_
