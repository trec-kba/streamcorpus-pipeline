  ## the same file system as their output.  This is also where the
  ## batch_transforms operate.
  tmp_dir_path: tmp/test-data

  ## task_queue specifies the strings that are passed to an extractor
  ## to obtain a Chunk.  The strings might be paths in a file system
  ## or some other source of data.  The task_queue might simply be
  ## stdin, or it might be a more sophisticated shared queue.
