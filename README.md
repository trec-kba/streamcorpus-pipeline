StreamCorpus Pipeline
=====================

streamcorpus_pipeline is a document processing pipeline that assembles
streamcorpus objects from raw data sets.

The streamcorpus_pipeline python module contains tools for processing
streamcorpus.StreamItem objects stored in Chunks.  It includes
transform functions for getting clean_html, clean_visible, creating
labels from hyperlinks to particular sites (e.g. Wikipedia), and
taggers like LingPipe, Serif, and Factorie, which make Tokens and
Sentences.
