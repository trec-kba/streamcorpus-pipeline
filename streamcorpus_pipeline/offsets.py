class XpathTextCollector(HTMLParser):
    '''Collects an HTML parse into an xpath.

    An instance of this class *statefully* constructs an xpath
    that corresponds to the HTML that has been parsed thus far.
    Basic usage of this class is to:

        1. Create the parser.
        2. Feed it some HTML.
        3. Ask for the xpath pointing to the location at which
           the aforementioned HTML ended.
        4. Go back to step 2 until all HTML has been consumed.

    This process is useful when you have a contiguous sequence
    of HTML fragments that, when concatenated, form a single
    HTML document. In particular, this enables one to compute
    *addresses* for each fragment.

    To that end, the xpaths generated by this class have a few
    very important properties:

        1. All xpaths *uniquely* identify a *single* text node
           in the HTML document.
        2. The offsets generated are actually of the form
           `(xpath, char offset)`, where the character offset
           indicates where the text starts in the text node
           addressed by `xpath`.
        3. The combination of two offsets forms a *range*, which
           is isomorphic to `Range` objects found in Javascript's
           standard library (which are used to represent user
           selections of text).
